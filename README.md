Combat instructions:

Your characters and the enemies will take turns to damage each other. When either all enemies or all the characters
from your party are dead, combat will end. Enemies heath is displayed as green bars above them and you party's
health will be displayed in the bottom right corner of the window.

At the start of each turn you can choose between Attack, Inventory, and Magic. To choose an action, click on the corresponding
button. 

-Attack: Click on an enemy to attack it with the equipped weapon.
Note: You won't be able to click this command if the character doesn't have a weapon equipped.
All your characters start without a weapon equipped so you will have to equip them with one before being able to attack an enemy.

-Inventory: 3 slots from your inventory will are shown at a time. You can scroll up and down this list by
clicking the "scroll Up" and "scroll Down" buttons. After clicking a slot, you can choose to either
equip the weapon in that slot, or swap it with other slot's weapon. If you chose to swap, you'll have to
click another slot and then "Confirm swap". Click on the return button after managing
your inventory and equipping a weapon to be able to choose Attack.

-Magic: Not yet implemented.
